i'm only working on the index.html atm

later gohugo.io will be used for static page generation
I figured out that is very important that i check what gohugo can do
before doing any design/development. So i'm going to stop any
design activity to dedicate myself to exploring this tool.

- try go hugo

Tools to use for this blog:

- HTML
- plain CSS (maybe bootstrap)
- vanilla JS
- maybe npm if i need it
- gohugo

## TO DO: 

- Make the active post coloured with this:
    ```
    document.querySelectorAll('a').forEach(function(links){
        console.log(links.href == document.URL)
    })
    ```
- add a "back to home" arrow button
- Use external JS (done on index.html, 4 to go)
- Use external fonts
- add a breadcumb navigation
- using an hastag system for categories

## consider:

- Changing the archive directory to YR -> M -> Post
- Make a better front logo (done)
- Make it accessible
